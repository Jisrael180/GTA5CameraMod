Congratulations on downloading the "Camera Lens Switcher" mod, and thus validating my lack of a social life.

This mod was created to help GTA-V's machinima making community have a little more flexibility when it comes to their cinematography, by allowing you to switch out the game's typical camera with a camera designed to replicate popular lenses used in film making. 
Do you fancy yourself a Christopher Nolan type? The 50mm might be for you. You could get your Stanley Kubrick on with an 18mm wide angle. Heck, you can get extra artsy with our 70mm tilt-shift lens. We have 10 different lenses to choose from, and 10 different depth of field settings to match said lenses.

I am putting this thing up on GitHub under the repository name GTA5CameraMod, so if you have additional lenses you want to add, the source code is up there.

This is my first attempt at creating a mod, but I have it on good authority that this mod should not cause your computer to explode. 

I hope that this mod helps you make great art that you can be proud of. 

Note: The lenses are not great for actual gameplay (the macro and tilt-shift are particularly difficult). This is made with machinima in mind, so be sure to have what you are going to record planned ahead of time 'cause you might be a little blind. Possibly good to set to a task via the Menyoo mod, or using the Scene Director mod. Menyoo's spooner mode also retain's the camera lens, so if you want to preview how it will look in Rockstar Editor, you can use the spooner mode to move the camera wherever you like.

REQUIREMENTS:
ScriptHookV
ScriptHookVDotNet
NativeUI
Open IV or Codewalker

INSTALLING:
Put file into your Grand Theft Auto V\scripts\ directory. If the scripts folder does not exist, create it (though, assuming you have all the above requirements, it would be weird if you didn't already have a scripts folder, right?)


Open your GTA V directory using OpenIV or Codewalker.
Navigate to \update\update.rpf\common\data\timecycle\ .
Enable Edit Mode in OpenIV.
Replace timecycle_mods_1.xml with the modified timecycle_mods_1.xml file provided in this mod. Ensure you have a backup of the original timecycle_mods_1.xml file because that file is fragile and you don't want to mess it up. 

HOW TO USE
